Basic todo list app made with React & redux.
Same as todo-app i made earlier, but i stopped using next.js and implemented redux.
I didnt made project with API this time, because of the mockapi.io's limitations.

# Run the project
git clone https://github.com/erenkulaksiz/todo-react.git
cd todo-react
npm install
npm start
