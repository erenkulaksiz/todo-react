# todo-react

Basic todo list app made with React & redux.<br/>
Same as todo-app i made earlier, but i stopped using next.js and implemented redux.<br/>
I didnt made project with API this time, because of the mockapi.io's limitations.<br/>

// Update: project now works with proper api! gratz for me :)

# Run the project
git clone https://github.com/erenkulaksiz/todo-react.git<br/>
cd todo-react<br/>
npm install<br/>
npm start<br/>
